# Ink & Signal Landing Page

Ink & Signal with polite glitch and museum-grade whimsy transmits this mindful travel planner. The emotional frequency oscillates between quiet and spectacle, trust and curiosity, through a single strange accent—transmission copper—appearing like signals marking destination discoveries.

Typography bleeds letterpress soul while broadcasting digital precision, analog travel memories meeting electronic itinerary clarity. The theatre stage spatial metaphor positions each destination as a broadcast performance awaiting reception. Slow zoom scroll choreography approaches destinations like radio signals strengthening, clarity increasing with proximity. Charcoal smudge texture grounds digital journeys in tactile reality. Motion pulses with signal rhythm, destinations connecting with radio-wave timing.

Anchoring references: printmaking grain celebrating travel documentation as reproducible art; instrument panel clarity making journey planning as intuitive as radio tuning; bookbinding craft sequencing destinations into travel log narratives.
