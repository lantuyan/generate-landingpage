# Archaeological UI Landing Page

Archaeological UI with calm chaos and tender machinery unearths this community logistics hub. The emotional excavation moves between clarity and mystery, gravity and lightness, through a single strange accent—terracotta—appearing like shards of community history pieced into present function.

Typography presents as decoded inscriptions, ancient forms carrying modern logistics. The map room spatial metaphor spreads community resources like archaeological site plans, territories of mutual aid awaiting exploration. Spiral reveal scroll choreography digs deeper with each rotation, uncovering layers of neighborhood infrastructure. Weathered stone patina ages interface elements with trustworthy permanence. Motion operates with gentle orbit, information circling like artifacts in museum rotation.

Reference anchors: archive architecture that preserves community memory while enabling new contributions; cartographic traditions mapping invisible networks of care; ritual objects understanding that tools of mutual aid carry ceremonial weight.
