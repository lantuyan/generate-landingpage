# Optical Field Notes Landing Page

Optical Field Notes design with polite glitch and formal play documents this local maker marketplace. The emotional optics refract between gravity and lightness, quiet and spectacle, through warm grayscale with sudden sunrise band—observational neutrality interrupted by discovery gold.

Typography annotates like field researcher handwriting translated to type, scientific precision with organic variation. The botanical lab bench spatial metaphor arranges maker goods like specimens under observation. Map journey scroll choreography leads visitors through artisan territories, each stop a documented finding. Frosted acrylic haze suggests microscope optics, familiar objects rendered with scientific wonder. Motion carries subtle tremor, the hand-held quality of genuine observation.

Reference anchors: field-journal documentation elevating everyday making to scientific discovery; wayfinding signage culture ensuring every visitor navigates to their treasure; gallery label writing distilling maker stories to essential truth.
