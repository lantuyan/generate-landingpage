# Editorial with Analog Tech Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE merging **Editorial** design with an **Analog Tech** micro-style overlay. Conceive an innovative business concept for a investigative journalism membership that funds deep-dive reporting on specific topics readers choose—climate corruption, tech monopolies, healthcare fraud—with subscribers receiving exclusive access to developing stories and source materials. The page should feel **rebellious** yet **grounded** from first contact—visitors sensing both the defiance of truth-telling and the serious craft of investigative work. The visual hierarchy unfolds like a long-form exposé, each scroll revealing new depths. Incorporate **single neon thread** as accent-color behavior—one urgent accent cutting through documentary sobriety.

The design philosophy embraces a **cinematic dissolve** scrolling rhythm—sections cross-fading like scenes in an investigative documentary, revelation building on revelation. Typography channels **poetic editorial**, feeling like the great tradition of investigative journalism, words that matter. The **recycled paper grain** texture metaphor adds newsprint authenticity to digital journalism, connecting to print traditions. Layouts follow **asymmetric tension** geometric language—magazine-spread sophistication suggesting editorial authority, images and text in deliberate imbalance. Motion embodies **frictiony slide** personality—elements with slight resistance, suggesting the difficulty of uncovering truth. The emotional arc flows: first impression of journalistic weight → curiosity about investigation scope → trust through reporting track record → desire for insider access → clarity of membership tiers → commitment to funded journalism.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of **mid-century editorial layouts**—when magazines were serious cultural institutions. Channel **hand-bound bookmaking** suggesting journalism worthy of archival preservation. Reference **experimental theater lighting** creating dramatic focus on revealed truth. These abstractions should influence a landing page that feels journalistically credible, aesthetically sophisticated, and urgently relevant—a single scrolling experience where journalism becomes subscriber-funded mission.
