# Archaeological UI Landing Page

An Archaeological UI aesthetic infused with misaligned perfection and tender machinery, built for a climate-adaptive home guidance platform that helps homeowners prepare their living spaces for shifting weather patterns. The emotional register oscillates between awe and intimacy, clarity and mystery, rendered through a mineral palette punctuated by a radioactive highlight that surfaces like an unearthed artifact demanding attention.

Typography behaves like excavation layers—stacked, precise, yet revealing deeper meaning as users scroll. The chaptered long-take scrolling choreography unfolds like walking through a museum corridor, where each section is a discovered chamber. Motion carries a museum-slow quality, with generous spacing acting as contemplative breath between discoveries. The emotional arc moves from curiosity to revelation to quiet understanding.

Reference anchors: The brutalist archaeology of Carlo Scarpa's Castelvecchio Museum informs the layered spatial treatment. The methodical poetry of Land Art movements—particularly Robert Smithson's entropy studies—shapes the temporal unfolding. The tactile quality of Japanese kintsugi repair, where fractures become features, guides how information fragments cohere into meaningful wholes.
