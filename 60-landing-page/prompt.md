# Mediterranean Design Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE using the **Mediterranean** design style. Conceive an innovative business concept for a artisan olive oil estate offering immersive tasting experiences, grove tours, and a subscription program delivering estate-pressed oils paired with recipes celebrating Mediterranean cuisine. The page should evoke a sense of sun-drenched warmth and rustic elegance from the first moment. Visitors should feel transported to golden afternoons—where terracotta glows in late light, olive leaves silver in the breeze, and centuries of tradition infuse every element. The visual hierarchy should feel organic and warm—rounded arches framing content, textures suggesting aged stone and weathered wood, compositions with the relaxed grace of al fresco dining. Incorporate the authentic palette—olive greens, terracotta oranges, Aegean blues, sun-bleached cream, and golden honey tones.

The typography should feel timeless yet approachable—elegant serifs suggesting carved inscriptions or wine labels, readable text that communicates heritage and quality. Interactions should create warm sensations—elements that appear with the slow warmth of rising sun, transitions that flow like olive oil, hover states that glow with Mediterranean light. The single-page journey should emotionally progress from immediate warmth (hero with golden-hour imagery and rustic elegance), through sensory discovery (content suggesting taste, aroma, and touch), to gracious invitation (call-to-action that feels like being welcomed to the table). The narrative arc celebrates tradition, terroir, and the civilizing pleasure of good food.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of Mediterranean living—the afternoon pause that restores energy, the meals that become occasions, the connection between land and table. Reference the patinated beauty of ancient architecture, the rustic elegance of farmhouse aesthetics, the unhurried pace of cultures built around shared meals. Think of the warmth of generous hospitality, the depth of multi-generational traditions, the simple luxury of quality ingredients. These abstract references should influence a design that feels warmly Mediterranean, rustically elegant, and generously inviting.
