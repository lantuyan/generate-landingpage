# Sonic Blueprint Landing Page

A Sonic Blueprint visual identity carrying formal play and anti-symmetry elegance, crafted for a community logistics hub where coordination moves like composed music. The mood balances quiet and spectacle, trust and curiosity, expressed through two-tone duotone with one forbidden color—a frequency violet that vibrates at decision points.

Typography pulses with rhythmic variation, arranged on a theatre stage spatial metaphor where scene cuts scrolling treats each section as a movement in a symphony. Motion follows a magnetic snap tempo, elements finding their positions with conductor precision. Spacing creates rests—silence that is as structured as sound.

Reference anchors: The acoustic precision of the Sydney Opera House's shell geometry shapes the resonant form-making. The visual music of Wassily Kandinsky's compositional theories informs the color-as-pitch philosophy. The craft of instrument making, particularly the graduated tensions of piano strings, guides the calibrated relationships between elements.
