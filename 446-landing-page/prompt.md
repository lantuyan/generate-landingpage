# Optical Field Notes Landing Page

An Optical Field Notes approach carrying diagrammatic romance and bureaucracy but beautiful, crafted for a climate-adaptive home guidance service that observes domestic ecosystems with naturalist precision. The mood oscillates between serenity and urgency, clarity and mystery, expressed through stormy blues interrupted by ember red—field observations marked by discovery flares.

Typography has specimen-label authority, arranged across a botanical lab bench spatial metaphor with tide in / tide out scrolling that follows observation rhythms. Motion follows a subtle tremor quality, instruments always slightly alive with measurement. Spacing reflects field notebook convention—compressed during active observation, expansive in synthetic reflection.

Reference anchors: The observational poetry of Le Corbusier's travel sketchbooks shapes the seeing-as-understanding philosophy. The systematic wonder of Mark Dion's pseudo-scientific installations informs the classification aesthetic. The craft of microscope slide preparation, with its careful mounting and labeled margins, guides the specimen presentation.
