# Paper Engineering Landing Page

A Paper Engineering aesthetic with museum-grade whimsy and slow shock, built for a mindful travel planner that unfolds journeys like pop-up books revealing destination surprises. The emotional construction balances awe and intimacy, quiet and spectacle—treating each trip as a dimensional structure to be assembled and explored. Color logic employs two-tone duotone with one forbidden color: paper white and fold shadow create depth, while a forbidden coral appears at destination highlights like a flower blooming from an otherwise restrained construction.

Typography folds into layouts like tab-and-slot assembly instructions, letterforms suggesting the poetry of dimensional transformation. Spacing operates as the depth between paper layers, parallax effects that reveal destination complexity through careful layering. The scrolling choreography follows an accordion expansion, travel options unfolding from flat summaries into three-dimensional itinerary structures. Motion carries a paper-flip mood, transitions that curl and unfold with the satisfying mechanics of well-engineered paper craft. The spatial metaphor spreads across a workshop table, where journeys are assembled with the care of architectural models before becoming real.

Reference anchors: The structural surprise of Masahiro Chatani's origamic architecture, the narrative engineering of elaborate Victorian paper theatres, and the precision craft of cartographic paper folding—creating a travel platform where destinations pop up with dimensional delight and planning becomes constructive play.
