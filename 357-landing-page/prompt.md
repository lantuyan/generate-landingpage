# Weather System Editorial Landing Page

A Weather System Editorial aesthetic with precision fog and anti-symmetry elegance, designed for an ethical AI toolkit that helps organizations implement responsible machine learning practices. The emotional atmosphere shifts between serenity and urgency, gravity and lightness—approaching AI ethics with the same measured attention meteorologists give to approaching storms. Color logic employs a mineral palette with radioactive highlight: granite grays, limestone whites, and obsidian blacks anchor the interface, with an electric violet appearing at warning indicators and decision points like lightning on the horizon.

Typography behaves like weather reports—clear, authoritative, designed for quick comprehension in changing conditions. Spacing operates as atmospheric pressure zones, varying density that guides the eye through ethical frameworks like fronts moving across a map. The scrolling choreography follows a slow zoom, beginning with global AI principles and gradually focusing down to specific implementation details. Motion carries a magnetic snap mood, elements locking into position with the certainty of compass needles finding north. The spatial metaphor extends across a subway platform wayfinding system, where ethical guidelines are posted for quick reference as decisions rush past.

Reference anchors: The transparent logic of Norman Foster's infrastructure projects, the systematic rigor of Swiss International Style, and the grounding practice of natural dyeing with mineral pigments—creating an AI ethics platform where complexity is made navigable and responsibility becomes visible.
