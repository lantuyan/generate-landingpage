# De Stijl Design Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE using the **De Stijl** design style. Conceive an innovative business concept for a modular furniture system that enables customers to design, customize, and reconfigure their own furniture pieces through an intuitive online configurator—true form following function with infinite personalization. The page should evoke a sense of pure geometric harmony and primary truth from the first moment. Visitors should feel the meditative clarity of absolute reduction—where only horizontal and vertical lines exist, only primary colors plus black and white speak, and every element achieves perfect balance through asymmetric equilibrium. The visual hierarchy should feel like a Mondrian composition—black lines creating grid structure, primary color blocks drawing attention, white space as active participant. Incorporate only the authentic palette—red, yellow, blue, black, and white.

The typography should feel geometrically pure—sans-serifs reduced to essential forms, perhaps custom-feeling letterforms that share the grid logic of the overall design. Interactions should create precise sensations—elements that slide along grid lines, color blocks that shift positions, transitions that respect horizontal and vertical purity. The single-page journey should emotionally progress from immediate recognition (hero as living Mondrian with interactive potential), through systematic exploration (content organized within the grid structure), to clear action (call-to-action as color block within the composition). The narrative arc celebrates universal harmony, systematic thinking, and the beauty of pure abstraction.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of abstract harmony—the satisfying balance of well-proportioned relationships, the universal language of pure geometry, the spiritual calm of resolved composition. Reference the architectural applications of De Stijl principles, the furniture designs of Rietveld, the total design philosophy that unified art and life. Think of the intellectual pleasure of systematic thinking, the democratic accessibility of universal forms, the optimistic belief in design's power to harmonize. These abstract references should influence a design that feels universally harmonious, purely geometric, and systematically beautiful.
