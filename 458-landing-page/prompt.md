# Cinematic Subtitles Landing Page

A Cinematic Subtitles aesthetic with slow shock and museum-grade whimsy frames this ethical AI toolkit. Emotional choreography navigates clarity and mystery alongside quiet and spectacle—machine learning as foreign film to be translated. A mineral palette with radioactive highlight grounds complex concepts in earth tones, algorithms glowing with uranium green understanding.

Typography appears as translation—text positioned with subtitle precision, entering from darkness into comprehension. Spacing creates letterbox proportions, horizontal bands of focus within vertical scroll. The chaptered long-take scroll choreography unfolds AI concepts as continuous scenes, each chapter a new perspective on the same unfolding story. Motion embraces museum-slow contemplation—ideas arriving with cinematic patience. The museum corridor spatial metaphor presents AI ethics as exhibition requiring careful walking-through.

Reference anchors: Tadao Ando's Church of the Light with its precise illumination; French New Wave's intellectual playfulness; the tactile craft of film splicing where separate moments become continuous story. These make complex AI accessible as authored experience.
