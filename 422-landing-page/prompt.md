# Synthetic Biology Garden Landing Page

A Synthetic Biology Garden visual language carrying misaligned perfection and calm chaos, crafted for an ethical AI toolkit where algorithms grow like cultivated organisms. The mood toggles between discipline and warmth, quiet and spectacle, expressed through stormy blues interrupted by ember red—bioluminescence in silicon soil.

Typography branches and divides, arranged on a botanical lab bench spatial metaphor with spiral reveal scrolling that follows growth patterns from seed to bloom. Motion breathes with liquid drift, elements flowing like cellular nutrients. Spacing follows organic logic—clustered where systems concentrate, sparse where dormancy rests.

Reference anchors: The controlled wilderness of Piet Oudolf's perennial gardens, where natural systems are gently guided, shapes the cultivation philosophy. The biological abstraction of Ernst Haeckel's scientific illustrations informs the organic formalism. The craft of grafting, where different genetic materials are persuaded to become one, guides the hybrid visual language.
