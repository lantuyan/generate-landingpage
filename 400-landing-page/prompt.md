# Sonic Blueprint Landing Page

A Sonic Blueprint aesthetic with slow shock and whispered maximalism, designed for a mindful travel planner that translates journeys into audible frequencies and visible waveforms of experience. The emotional register navigates between serenity and urgency, quiet and spectacle—making travel planning feel like composing a symphony of destinations. Color logic employs two-tone duotone with one forbidden color: acoustic blue and studio gray set the score, while a forbidden vermillion appears at must-see destinations like a fortissimo marking demanding attention.

Typography resonates with the rhythm of musical notation, spacing between characters suggesting tempo and dynamic instructions for the journey ahead. Spacing functions as the rests in a travel composition, calculated silences between experiences that give the destinations around them meaning. The scrolling choreography performs a spiral reveal, destinations circling inward toward the trip's crescendo like a melody resolving to its destination. Motion holds a liquid drift mood, itinerary elements flowing into position with the smooth inevitability of sound waves building. The spatial metaphor creates an observatory deck, where travel possibilities are monitored like cosmic signals being composed into coherent journeys.

Reference anchors: The acoustic wonder of Iannis Xenakis's Philips Pavilion, the visual rhythm of Wassily Kandinsky's synaesthetic compositions, and the precision craft of tuning fork manufacturing—creating a travel platform where journeys become compositions and destinations harmonize into memorable experience.
