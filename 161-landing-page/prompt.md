# Neo-Geo with Soft Industrial Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE merging **Neo-Geo** design with a **Soft Industrial** micro-style overlay. Conceive an innovative business concept for a renewable energy comparison platform that helps homeowners evaluate solar, battery, and heat pump options—providing personalized ROI calculations, installer matching, and financing options for residential clean energy adoption. The page should feel **daring** yet **grounded** from first contact—visitors sensing both the bold visual energy and the practical reality of home improvements. The visual hierarchy explodes with geometric confidence while industrial touches suggest real equipment. Incorporate **gradient wash** as accent-color behavior—colors bleeding across shapes like energy flowing through systems.

The design philosophy embraces a **staircase** scrolling rhythm—ascending through energy options, each plateau a new tier of home efficiency. Typography channels **clinical precision**, feeling like equipment specifications made readable, technical authority accessible. The **satin metal** texture metaphor adds equipment elegance throughout, solar panels and batteries as industrial beauty. Layouts follow **oblique cuts** geometric language—diagonal slices creating dynamic energy, nothing static when renewable power flows. Motion embodies **magnetic snap** personality—elements clicking into place like system components connecting. The emotional arc flows: first impression of geometric possibility → curiosity about personalization → trust through calculator accuracy → desire for energy independence → clarity of installation process → commitment to renewable transition.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of **scientific instrument panels**—interfaces for monitoring energy systems. Channel **modernist civic architecture** suggesting energy infrastructure as home improvement. Reference **parametric architecture models** where algorithm optimizes complex systems. These abstractions should influence a landing page that feels visually bold, technically credible, and practically helpful—a single scrolling experience where renewable energy becomes personalized reality.
