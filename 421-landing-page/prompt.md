# Hyperlocal Craft Ledger Landing Page

A Hyperlocal Craft Ledger aesthetic infused with slow shock and museum-grade whimsy, built for a health routine architect that documents wellness practices with the care of a neighborhood chronicle. The emotional architecture balances nostalgia and futurism, trust and curiosity, rendered through pastels with one surgical hue—an archival amber that authenticates each entry.

Typography follows ledger rules, arranged across an archive drawer spatial metaphor with stair-step certainty scrolling that descends through record categories. Motion carries a paper-flip quality, pages turning with satisfying weight. Spacing honors the ruled line—regular rhythm with calculated exceptions that mark important entries.

Reference anchors: The civic warmth of Victorian-era public libraries, with their reading room silence and catalog drawers, shapes the institutional intimacy. The documentary beauty of Walker Evans' vernacular sign photography informs the found-typography sensitivity. The craft of copperplate engraving, with its ruled lines and flourished capitals, provides the formal elegance.
