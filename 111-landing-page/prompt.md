# Neo-Geo with Typographic Sculpture Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE merging **Neo-Geo** design with a **Typographic Sculpture** micro-style overlay. Conceive an innovative business concept for a climate resilience mapping tool that visualizes flood zones, heat islands, wildfire risks, and infrastructure vulnerabilities—helping property buyers, urban planners, and insurance professionals assess location-specific climate risks. The page should feel **daring** yet **grounded** from first contact—visitors sensing both bold visual language and scientific credibility. The visual hierarchy explodes with geometric confidence while maintaining informational clarity. Incorporate **gradient wash** as accent-color behavior—colors bleeding across shapes to suggest climate data gradients and risk spectrums.

The design philosophy embraces a **staccato** scrolling rhythm—information delivered in sharp, definitive bursts, each section a distinct data revelation. Typography becomes sculptural, letters as architectural forms, **judicial authority** in voice—pronouncements about climate reality that demand attention. The **ink bleed** texture metaphor adds organic unpredictability to geometric precision, suggesting how climate effects spread beyond neat boundaries. Layouts follow **oblique cuts** geometric language—diagonal slices creating dynamic tension, nothing static when climate is changing. Motion embodies **magnetic snap** personality—elements clicking into place with decisive energy, data visualizations that feel alive. The emotional arc flows: first impression of urgent visual power → curiosity about risk methodology → trust through data sources → desire for location assessment → clarity of report contents → commitment to informed decisions.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of **modernist civic architecture**—design in service of public information and democratic access. Channel **scientific instrument panels** where complex measurements become readable through careful design. Reference **desert twilight gradients** suggesting the climate futures being mapped. These abstractions should influence a landing page that feels visually bold, scientifically serious, and urgently relevant—a single scrolling experience where climate data becomes actionable understanding.
