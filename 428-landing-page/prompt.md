# Algorithmic Quilt Landing Page

An Algorithmic Quilt aesthetic marked by polite glitch and silent comedy, constructed for a community logistics hub where coordination patterns emerge from stitched data. The mood balances gravity and lightness, trust and curiosity, expressed through two-tone duotone with one forbidden color—a thread-gold that traces connection pathways.

Typography tessellates in repeating modules, arranged on a workshop table spatial metaphor with spiral reveal scrolling that exposes the pattern's generative logic. Motion follows a gentle orbit rhythm, pieces finding their quilted positions. Spacing follows block mathematics—regular grids creating visual heartbeat with intentional irregularities for warmth.

Reference anchors: The communal geometry of Amish quilts, where collective labor becomes individual expression, shapes the participatory aesthetic. The algorithmic art of Vera Molnar's computed variations informs the systematic playfulness. The craft of patchwork piecing, where scraps accumulate into warmth, guides the compositional abundance.
