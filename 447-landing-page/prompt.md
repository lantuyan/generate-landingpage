# Gravity-Defying Catalog Landing Page

A Gravity-Defying Catalog visual language woven with silent comedy and whispered maximalism, designed for a health routine architect where wellness practices float in accessible orbits. The emotional register balances nostalgia and futurism, awe and intimacy, rendered through two-tone duotone with one forbidden color—a levitation violet that suspends key elements.

Typography defies baseline gravity, arranged on an observatory deck spatial metaphor with map journey scrolling that navigates constellation-like clusters. Motion carries a gentle orbit quality, elements drifting with planetary patience. Spacing creates gravitational fields—dense clusters and empty voids that guide attention through celestial mechanics.

Reference anchors: The suspended wonder of Anish Kapoor's reflective voids shapes the weightless contemplation. The cosmic organization of Ray and Charles Eames' "Powers of Ten" informs the scale-shifting navigation. The craft of orrery making, with its balanced mechanical orbits, provides the systematic motion logic.
