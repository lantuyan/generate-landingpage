# Gravity-Defying Catalog Landing Page

A Gravity-Defying Catalog visual identity woven with dusty neon and formal play, designed for a private learning studio where knowledge orbits in accessible constellations. The emotional register balances nostalgia and futurism, gravity and lightness, rendered through pastels with one surgical hue—a zero-gravity cyan that makes elements float.

Typography escapes linear baselines, arranged on an observatory deck spatial metaphor with map journey scrolling that navigates spatial rather than temporal sequences. Motion carries a gentle orbit quality, words drifting into and out of gravitational wells. Spacing creates orbital mechanics—elements cluster around dense content and scatter toward margins.

Reference anchors: The suspended contemplation of Olafur Eliasson's spherical installations shapes the weightless wonder. The cosmic mapping of Aby Warburg's Mnemosyne Atlas informs the constellation-as-organization principle. The craft of planetarium projection, with its dome-spanning star fields, provides the immersive spatial logic.
