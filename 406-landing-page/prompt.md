# Synthetic Biology Garden Landing Page

A Synthetic Biology Garden aesthetic carrying dusty neon and precision fog, designed for a health routine architect service that cultivates personalized wellness protocols like living organisms. The mood oscillates between awe and intimacy, serenity and urgency, expressed through pastels with one surgical hue—a bioluminescent cyan that pulses through organic forms.

Typography grows and branches across a botanical lab bench spatial metaphor, with slow zoom scrolling that draws viewers deeper into cellular-scale details. Motion breathes with a liquid drift quality, elements flowing like nutrients through membranes. Spacing follows growth patterns—clustered where activity concentrates, sparse where rest is prescribed.

Reference anchors: The glass and steel of Victorian-era palm houses, particularly Kew Gardens, shapes the container-for-life philosophy. The bio-art movement's fusion of laboratory and gallery—especially Eduardo Kac's transgenic works—informs the living aesthetic. The craft of botanical illustration, with its scientific precision and artistic sensitivity, guides the rendering of health as visible growth.
