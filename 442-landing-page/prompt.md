# Paper Engineering Landing Page

A Paper Engineering approach carrying polite glitch and calm chaos, crafted for a mindful travel planner where destinations unfold like carefully engineered pop-up surprises. The mood toggles between nostalgia and futurism, serenity and urgency, expressed through warm grayscale with a sudden sunrise band—paper edges catching destination light.

Typography folds and hinges, arranged on a workshop table spatial metaphor with accordion expansion scrolling that mimics the reveal of layered paper constructions. Motion follows a paper-flip cadence, sections opening with satisfying mechanical precision. Spacing respects structural logic—compressed at fold lines, expansive where panels open fully.

Reference anchors: The mechanical wonder of historical automata, where paper and gears create movement, shapes the animated philosophy. The constructivist playfulness of El Lissitzky's children's books informs the geometric dynamism. The craft of tunnel books, with their layered depth and peep-show perspective, guides the spatial revelation strategy.
