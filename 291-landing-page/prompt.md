# Illustrated with Bauhaus Revival Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE merging **Illustrated** design with a **Bauhaus Revival** micro-style overlay. Conceive an innovative business concept for a vintage toy restoration service that repairs, restores, and authenticates collectible toys from the 1950s through 1990s—bringing childhood treasures back to displayable condition while preserving their sentimental and monetary value. The page should feel **whimsical** yet **confident** from first contact—visitors sensing both the playful nostalgia of vintage toys and the serious craftsmanship of professional restoration. The visual hierarchy plays through custom illustration while Bauhaus geometry provides structural clarity. Incorporate **primary triad** as accent-color behavior—the bold primaries of classic toys and Bauhaus design philosophy united.

The design philosophy embraces a **cascade** scrolling rhythm—elements revealing like toys emerging from attic boxes, childhood treasures rediscovering themselves. Typography channels **friendly mentor**, feeling like guidance from a craftsperson who respects both sentiment and skill, warm expertise. The **matte plastic** texture metaphor adds toy materiality throughout, the surfaces of beloved playthings. Layouts follow **strict grid** geometric language—Bauhaus rigor organizing the playful chaos of toy collections. Motion embodies **workshop rhythm** personality—elements moving with the care and precision of restoration work. The emotional arc flows: first impression of nostalgic possibility → curiosity about restoration capabilities → trust through before-after evidence → desire for toy resurrection → clarity of service tiers → commitment to restoration project.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of **children's museum exhibits**—where toys become cultural artifacts. Channel **artisanal ceramics studio** where craft meets care. Reference **mid-century editorial layouts** when toy advertisements were art forms. These abstractions should influence a landing page that feels playfully illustrated, geometrically grounded, and restoration-focused—a single scrolling experience where vintage toys become treasured once more.
