# Cyberpunk Design Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE using the **Cyberpunk** aesthetic. Conceive an innovative business concept for an underground tech marketplace connecting independent hardware modders, custom PC builders, and cybersecurity specialists with clients seeking non-corporate technology solutions. The page should evoke a sense of high-tech rebellion and urban digital culture from the first moment. Visitors should feel they've jacked into the underground—where neon cuts through perpetual rain, technology serves the people not corporations, and information wants to be free. The visual hierarchy should feel like navigating a hacked interface—glitched elements revealing hidden information, layered data streams, and terminal aesthetics merged with street culture. Incorporate the signature palette—electric cyan, hot magenta, toxic green against deep blacks and rain-slicked surfaces.

The typography should feel hacked and technical—monospace terminal fonts mixed with glitched display type, kanji and code symbols integrated into headers. Interactions should create electric, unstable sensations—elements that glitch on hover, scanlines that pulse, data that appears to stream in real-time. The single-page journey should emotionally progress from immersive entrance (hero with rain effects and neon-drenched cityscapes), through underground discovery (content presented as decrypted data packets), to rebellious action (call-to-action that feels like initiating a system override). The narrative arc celebrates technological empowerment, digital resistance, and the democratization of technology.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of rainy city nights—neon signs reflecting in wet pavement, the anonymity of crowded streets, the hidden communities in urban shadows. Reference the atmosphere of underground hacker culture, the aesthetic of DIY electronics and maker spaces, the visual language of science fiction that warned us about corporate dystopia. Think of the thrill of forbidden knowledge, the solidarity of counter-culture communities, the beauty found in technological chaos. These abstract references should influence a design that feels rebelliously technological, atmospherically dark, and authentically underground.
