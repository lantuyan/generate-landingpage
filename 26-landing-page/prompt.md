# Material Design Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE using the **Material Design** style. Conceive an innovative business concept for a smart home ecosystem platform that unifies all connected devices under one intuitive interface with automation recipes and energy optimization. The page should evoke a sense of intelligent organization and tactile familiarity from the first moment. Visitors should feel the satisfying logic of physical materials translated to digital—surfaces that layer naturally, shadows that suggest real depth and hierarchy. The visual hierarchy should feel architectural—cards floating at different elevations, content organized in logical containers that feel substantial. Incorporate a primary brand color with complementary accent, following systematic color relationships.

The typography should feel systematic and readable—Roboto-style typefaces that balance geometric precision with humanist warmth, a clear typographic scale that creates rhythm. Interactions should create responsive, physical sensations—ripple effects emanating from touch points, cards that lift when selected, smooth transitions that respect momentum and physics. Floating action buttons should feel like tangible objects. The single-page journey should emotionally progress from welcoming introduction (hero with layered surfaces and clear focal point), through systematic discovery (content organized in elevation-aware cards), to intuitive action (FAB or prominent button that invites touch). The narrative arc celebrates order, responsiveness, and the comfort of familiar patterns.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of well-designed physical products—the satisfying click of quality hardware, the intuitive layout of control panels, the reassuring feedback of mechanical switches. Reference the organized efficiency of filing systems, the layered depth of architect's models, the systematic beauty of modular furniture. Think of the responsive feedback of quality touchscreens, the logical organization of well-designed apps, the comfortable familiarity of learned patterns. These abstract references should influence a design that feels responsive, organized, and intuitively familiar.
