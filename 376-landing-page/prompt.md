# Paper Engineering Landing Page

A Paper Engineering aesthetic with precision fog and anti-symmetry elegance, designed for a quiet finance companion that makes money management feel as tactile as a well-constructed pop-up book. The emotional construction balances clarity and mystery, gravity and lightness—treating financial data as paper structures to be unfolded and understood. Color logic employs two-tone duotone with one forbidden color: paper white and soft graphite create the folds, while a forbidden magenta appears at wealth milestones like a surprise element in an otherwise restrained construction.

Typography folds into layouts like tab-and-slot assembly, letterforms that suggest instruction diagrams and the poetry of dimensional transformation. Spacing operates as the depth between paper layers, parallax effects that reveal complexity through layering rather than density. The scrolling choreography follows an accordion expansion, financial tools unfolding from flat states into three-dimensional utility. Motion carries a paper-flip mood, transitions that curl and unfold with the satisfying mechanics of well-engineered paper craft. The spatial metaphor spreads across a workshop table, where financial structures are assembled with the care of architectural models.

Reference anchors: The structural innovation of Shigeru Ban's material experiments, the kinetic engineering of pop-up book pioneers like Robert Sabuda, and the precision craft of origami tessellation—creating a finance platform where money becomes tangible and understanding unfolds in your hands.
