# Topographic Calm Landing Page

A Topographic Calm approach infused with polite glitch and tender machinery, crafted for an ethical AI toolkit that maps the terrain of algorithmic decision-making with surveyor's care. The mood oscillates between clarity and mystery, serenity and urgency, rendered through stormy blues interrupted by ember red—decision contours glowing with consequence.

Typography follows data elevation, arranged within a map room spatial metaphor with stair-step certainty scrolling that descends through complexity levels. Motion carries a gentle orbit quality, elements finding their topographic positions. Spacing follows contour logic—compressed where ethical complexity peaks, expansive across clearer algorithmic plains.

Reference anchors: The landscape respect of Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where terrain becomes meaning, shapes the ground-truth philosophy. The information cartography of Jacques Bertin's graphic semiology informs the visual encoding strategy. The craft of contour model making, with its stacked layers revealing elevation truth, guides the dimensional clarity.
