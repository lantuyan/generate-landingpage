# Synthetic Biology Garden Landing Page

A Synthetic Biology Garden approach with dusty neon and calm chaos cultivates this creative workflow atelier. The emotional ecosystem balances nostalgia and futurism alongside quiet and spectacle—creative tools as organisms in designed ecosystem. A mineral palette with radioactive highlight: growth medium beige and specimen green with bioluminescent alert cyan.

Typography grows with organic mutation, letterforms varying within species-like consistency. Spacing creates growth zones and containment margins, the controlled chaos of productive cultivation. The spiral reveal scroll choreography mimics genetic spiral, creative tools unwinding into view. Motion embraces liquid drift—elements flowing like nutrient solution through studio ecosystem. The botanical lab bench spatial metaphor presents workflow tools as cultivated specimens, creativity as garden to tend.

Reference anchors: Diller Scofidio's Blur Building as atmosphere architecture; the Bio-Art movement's living creations; the tactile craft of grafting where different organisms become one. These make creative workflow feel like synthetic garden cultivation.
