# Duotone Design Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE using the **Duotone** design style. Conceive an innovative business concept for a podcast production studio specializing in narrative storytelling—creating high-quality audio documentaries and branded podcast series for media companies and brands. The page should evoke a sense of bold simplicity and dramatic impact from the first moment. Visitors should feel the focused intensity of limited palette—where two carefully chosen colors create unlimited emotional range through their interplay. The visual hierarchy should be built through tonal relationships—dramatic high-contrast areas for emphasis, subtle gradations for depth, the push-pull of two colors creating dynamic compositions. Choose an intentional color pairing—deep purple with electric orange, navy with coral, forest green with gold.

The typography should feel confident and clear—typefaces that stand bold against the duotone imagery, weights that create hierarchy within the limited color system. Interactions should create color-shift sensations—duotone images that swap palettes on hover, elements that transition between the two colors, smooth gradients revealing alternate colorways. The single-page journey should emotionally progress from striking impact (hero with dramatic duotone photography), through bold exploration (content unified by the consistent color treatment), to decisive action (call-to-action that uses color contrast for emphasis). The narrative arc celebrates focus, impact, and the power of creative constraint.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of dramatic photography—the emotional amplification that comes from simplified color, the iconic impact of limited palettes. Reference the bold confidence of screen-printed posters, the unifying effect of photographic color treatments, the sophistication of editorial color grading. Think of the artistic constraint that breeds creativity, the memorable impact of signature color combinations, the cohesion created when everything lives in the same color world. These abstract references should influence a design that feels dramatically bold, cohesively styled, and memorably focused.
