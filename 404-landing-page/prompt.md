# Negative Space Theatre Landing Page

A Negative Space Theatre approach marked by formal play and calm chaos, constructed for an ethical AI toolkit platform that makes machine learning decisions visible and comprehensible. The emotional architecture toggles between discipline and warmth, quiet and spectacle, expressed through two-tone duotone with one forbidden color—a theatrical violet that appears only at moments of revelation.

Text performs on a theatre stage spatial metaphor, entering and exiting with scene cuts scrolling choreography that treats each viewport as an act. Motion follows a paper-flip cadence, crisp and decisive yet playful. Typography spacing creates dramatic pauses—the emptiness between words becomes as meaningful as the words themselves, silence as dialogue.

Reference anchors: The spatial drama of Peter Brook's empty stage philosophy dictates the confident use of void. The graphic restraint of Polish poster design, where absence screams, guides the compositional boldness. The craft of shadow puppetry, where negative shapes tell stories, informs how absent elements define present ones.
