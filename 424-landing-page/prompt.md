# Cinematic Subtitles Landing Page

A Cinematic Subtitles visual identity marked by dusty neon and formal play, constructed for a micro-volunteering network where small actions unfold like scenes in an ensemble film. The mood oscillates between nostalgia and futurism, gravity and lightness, expressed through two-tone duotone with one forbidden color—a projection-blue that flickers at emotional peaks.

Typography appears in the lower register like a subway platform wayfinding, with chaptered long-take scrolling that treats each volunteer opportunity as a narrative beat. Motion carries a signal pulse rhythm, text arriving like transmitted messages. Spacing creates reading time—pauses that mirror the gap between foreign speech and translated meaning.

Reference anchors: The neon poetry of Wong Kar-wai's Hong Kong, where signage becomes emotional landscape, shapes the chromatic warmth. The temporal stretching of Chantal Akerman's durational cinema informs the patient pacing. The craft of hand-lettered film titles, with their considered kerning and weighted strokes, provides the typographic personality.
