# Paper Engineering Landing Page

Paper Engineering design with misaligned perfection and calm chaos constructs this micro-volunteering network. The emotional fold spans discipline and warmth, nostalgia and futurism, expressed through pastels with one surgical hue—a precise crimson marking urgent volunteer needs.

Typography creases and unfolds, dimensionality emerging from flat information. The workshop table spatial metaphor spreads volunteer opportunities like patterns waiting to be cut and assembled. Accordion expansion scroll choreography mimics actual paper mechanics—sections opening to reveal depth, collapsing to manage complexity. Folded paper edges are literal here, shadow and dimension creating tactile promise. Motion carries paper-flip authenticity, interfaces responding with the physics of actual material.

Three anchors: bookbinding craft that assembles discrete acts into coherent service narratives; field-journal documentation recording volunteer impact with scientific care; printmaking grain celebrating the reproducible nature of good deeds.
