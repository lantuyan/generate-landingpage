# Archaeological UI Landing Page

An Archaeological UI philosophy with whispered maximalism and calm chaos unearths this quiet finance companion. The emotional excavation balances trust and curiosity alongside discipline and warmth—money as artifact to be carefully uncovered and understood. A mineral palette with radioactive highlight: excavation earth tones and sediment gray with prosperity gold glowing from discovered strata.

Typography appears stratified, different typographic periods layered like financial history. Spacing creates dig squares and context margins, the archaeological organization of monetary complexity. The map journey scroll choreography moves through financial terrain as expedition, each section a new dig site of understanding. Motion embraces museum-slow patience—financial concepts surfacing with careful excavation care. The archive drawer spatial metaphor presents financial tools as catalogued finds, planning as archaeological retrieval.

Reference anchors: David Chipperfield's layered museum renovations; the Process Art movement's visible making; the tactile craft of stratigraphic illustration documenting what layers mean. These make money management feel like careful personal archaeology.
