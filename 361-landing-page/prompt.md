# Urban Fossil Modernism Landing Page

An Urban Fossil Modernism aesthetic with misaligned perfection and bureaucracy but beautiful, built for a climate-adaptive home guidance platform that merges geological time with urgent present action. The emotional stratigraphy shifts between nostalgia and futurism, serenity and urgency—treating cities as living fossils revealing patterns for sustainable futures. Color logic employs stormy blues interrupted by ember red: concrete grays and sedimentary browns layer beneath sudden veins of rust and copper that mark climate stress points like oxidation in stone.

Typography presents like inscriptions on modernist monuments—bold, structural, designed to outlast the moment of reading. Spacing calculates as the distance between building floors, regular yet varied by function and emphasis. The scrolling choreography embodies a stair-step certainty, each climate adaptation strategy building solidly upon the last like floors of a well-designed structure. Motion holds a magnetic snap mood, elements settling into grid positions with the finality of stone set in mortar. The spatial metaphor extends through a subway platform wayfinding system, where climate guidance is posted with the same clarity as transit directions—essential information for the journey ahead.

Reference anchors: The preserved modernism of Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation, the urban archaeology lens of Gordon Matta-Clark's building cuts, and the enduring craft of terrazzo floor installation—creating a climate platform where buildings teach us to read the future in their bones.
