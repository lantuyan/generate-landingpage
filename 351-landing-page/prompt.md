# Archaeological UI Landing Page

An Archaeological UI aesthetic with misaligned perfection and tender machinery, designed for a climate-adaptive home guidance platform that helps homeowners prepare their living spaces for shifting weather patterns. The emotional register oscillates between awe and intimacy, clarity and mystery—inviting users into a space that feels both ancient and predictive. The color logic follows a mineral palette with radioactive highlight: deep ochres, chalky whites, and fossilized grays punctuated by an unexpected phosphorescent green that signals key interactions.

Typography behaves like excavated inscriptions—measured, weighted, appearing as if brushed free from sediment. Spacing operates as breath between discoveries, generous voids that let each element settle into significance. The scrolling choreography follows a chaptered long-take approach, where each section unfolds like a new stratum of earth being carefully revealed. Motion carries a museum-slow mood, transitions that honor the gravity of each reveal. The spatial metaphor draws from a museum corridor, guiding visitors past climate data and home recommendations as if they were artifacts of possible futures.

Reference anchors: The brutalist preservation of Tadao Ando's concrete meditation spaces, the methodical wonder of the Bauhaus archival sensibility, and the patient craftsmanship of Japanese kintsugi repair—these three influences shape a landing page that treats home climate adaptation as both science and reverence, where cracks in our environment are highlighted with golden insight rather than hidden from view.
