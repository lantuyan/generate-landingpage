# Neo-Geo with Zen Kinetics Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE merging **Neo-Geo** design with a **Zen Kinetics** micro-style overlay. Conceive an innovative business concept for a movement practice app that combines multiple modalities—yoga, qi gong, stretching, mobility work—into personalized daily routines based on energy levels, available time, and body needs. The page should feel **daring** yet **serene** from first contact—visitors sensing both the bold geometric energy and the peaceful calm of mindful movement. The visual hierarchy explodes with geometric confidence while zen motion suggests the flowing practice within. Incorporate **gradient wash** as accent-color behavior—colors bleeding like energy flowing through movement sequences.

The design philosophy embraces a **tide** scrolling rhythm—information flowing in natural cycles that mirror the breath of movement practice. Typography channels **friendly mentor**, feeling like guidance from a movement teacher who integrates traditions, warm expertise. The **woven fabric** texture metaphor adds mat and prop tactility throughout, the surfaces of movement practice. Layouts follow **concentric geometry** geometric language—the practitioner at center, expanding circles of movement capability. Motion embodies **gentle breathing** personality—elements with subtle expansion and contraction, the page moving with practice. The emotional arc flows: first impression of integrated movement → curiosity about modality coverage → trust through teacher credentials → desire for personalized routine → clarity of app features → commitment to daily practice.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of **zen gardens**—designed environments for embodied presence. Channel **ballet rehearsal minimalism** where practice enables flow. Reference **parametric architecture models** where algorithm serves physical wellbeing. These abstractions should influence a landing page that feels geometrically bold, peacefully moving, and personally adaptive—a single scrolling experience where movement becomes integrated practice.
