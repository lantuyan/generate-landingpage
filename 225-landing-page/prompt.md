# Neobrutalist with Analog Tech Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE merging **Neobrutalist** design with an **Analog Tech** micro-style overlay. Conceive an innovative business concept for a right-to-repair advocacy platform that provides repair guides, parts sourcing, tool recommendations, and connects fixers with local repair cafes—fighting planned obsolescence through community repair. The page should feel **rebellious** yet **grounded** from first contact—visitors sensing both the defiance of throwaway culture and the practical reality of fixing things. The visual hierarchy shouts with brutalist honesty while analog touches suggest workshop tools and repair benches. Incorporate **single neon thread** as accent-color behavior—raw restraint with one urgent accent highlighting repair victories.

The design philosophy embraces a **staircase** scrolling rhythm—ascending through repair difficulty levels, each plateau a new tier of fixer capability. Typography channels **artisan craft**, feeling like repair manuals written by people who fix things, technical with mission. The **soft rubber** texture metaphor adds tool grip warmth to brutalist surfaces, the tactile reality of repair work. Layouts follow **bold frames** geometric language—heavy borders containing repair categories like toolboxes. Motion embodies **frictiony slide** personality—elements with slight resistance like stuck components coming loose. The emotional arc flows: first impression of repair rebellion → curiosity about fix coverage → trust through guide quality → desire for repair skills → clarity of community resources → commitment to fixing culture.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of **modernist civic architecture**—brutalism serving public repair access. Channel **scientific instrument panels** where diagnostic tools become accessible. Reference **artisanal ceramics studio** where repair is honored craft. These abstractions should influence a landing page that feels radically honest, practically helpful, and community-empowering—a single scrolling experience where repair becomes resistance.
