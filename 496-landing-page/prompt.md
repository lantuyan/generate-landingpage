# Optical Field Notes Landing Page

An Optical Field Notes approach with diagrammatic romance and formal play documents this climate-adaptive home guidance platform. The emotional observation balances discipline and warmth alongside nostalgia and futurism—sustainability as phenomenon to observe and record. Two-tone duotone with one forbidden color: field notebook tan and carbon pencil gray interrupted by data-point chartreuse.

Typography mimics field notation urgency, the hurried recording of important observation made systematic. Spacing creates specimen margins and data tables, the organized space for environmental discovery. The stair-step certainty scroll choreography builds sustainable understanding through progressive observation recording. Motion carries signal pulse—readings arriving from home-as-field-site monitoring. The botanical lab bench spatial metaphor presents climate solutions as specimens for study, home improvement as research project.

Reference anchors: Renzo Piano's California Academy of Sciences responding to ecosystem; the Environmental Art movement's documentation practices; the tactile craft of scientific illustration where observation becomes record. These make home sustainability feel like citizen science.
