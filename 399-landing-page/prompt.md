# Archaeological UI Landing Page

An Archaeological UI aesthetic with dusty neon and formal play, crafted for a creative workflow atelier that treats design process as excavation—uncovering layers of creative decision buried beneath each project. The emotional layers shift between awe and intimacy, discipline and warmth—each workflow step revealing something valuable that was always there. Color logic follows a mineral palette with radioactive highlight: excavation tan and fossil gray form the strata, while a radioactive magenta appears at creative breakthroughs like finding something impossible in the dig.

Typography emerges like inscriptions carefully brushed free, letterforms carrying the weight of recovered creative wisdom. Spacing operates as the careful distance between excavation sites, room for each workflow discovery to be documented and appreciated. The scrolling choreography embodies a chaptered long-take, each project phase unfolding as a complete stratum before descending to the next layer. Motion carries a subtle tremor mood, the slight vibration of careful work revealing something previously buried. The spatial metaphor extends through a museum corridor, where creative processes are displayed like artifacts in a gallery of methodology.

Reference anchors: The layered revelation of Carlo Scarpa's Castelvecchio restoration, the systematic documentation of archaeological site photography, and the patient restoration craft of fresco cleaning—creating a creative platform where workflow feels discovered rather than invented, and process becomes permanent exhibition.
