# Archaeological UI Landing Page

An Archaeological UI philosophy with formal play and bureaucracy but beautiful excavates this local maker marketplace. The emotional dig balances nostalgia and futurism alongside awe and intimacy—handmade goods as artifacts from living craft traditions. Warm grayscale with sudden sunrise band illuminates discoveries: dig site neutrals with revelation golden moments.

Typography appears in strata, different weights layered like archaeological periods of making. Spacing creates excavation grid, careful squares organizing the discovery of craft. The chaptered long-take scroll choreography moves through maker histories as continuous dig, each chapter a new depth of understanding. Motion embraces museum-slow reverence—products surfacing with the patience of careful excavation. The archive drawer spatial metaphor presents goods as catalogued finds, shopping as archaeological retrieval.

Reference anchors: Rafael Moneo's Roman museum built on excavation; the Process Art movement's revelation of making; the tactile craft of artifact preservation where handling becomes honoring. These make marketplace shopping feel like field archaeology.
