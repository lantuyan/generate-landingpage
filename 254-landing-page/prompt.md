# Bauhaus with Analog Tech Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE merging **Bauhaus** design with an **Analog Tech** micro-style overlay. Conceive an innovative business concept for a woodworking skills platform that teaches furniture making through video courses—from hand tool basics to joinery techniques to complete furniture projects, with tool recommendations and wood sourcing guidance. The page should feel **confident** yet **grounded** from first contact—visitors sensing both the Bauhaus clarity of functional design and the tactile reality of woodwork. The visual hierarchy presents with Bauhaus confidence while analog touches suggest workshop tools. Incorporate **mineral tones with one vivid pop** as accent-color behavior—wood tones with strategic accent marking skill achievements.

The design philosophy embraces a **staircase** scrolling rhythm—ascending through skill levels, each plateau a new woodworking capability. Typography channels **artisan craft**, feeling like workshop manuals with soul, technical with maker pride. The **recycled paper grain** texture metaphor adds workshop materiality throughout, the surfaces of woodworking documentation. Layouts follow **modular tiles** geometric language—Bauhaus blocks containing different techniques, the building blocks of furniture skills. Motion embodies **frictiony slide** personality—elements with slight resistance like wood planes against grain. The emotional arc flows: first impression of functional craft → curiosity about curriculum depth → trust through furniture examples → desire for making skills → clarity of course structure → commitment to woodworking journey.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of **artisanal ceramics studio**—where making creates through patient practice. Channel **high-end atelier craftsmanship** suggesting furniture as precision art. Reference **modernist civic architecture** suggesting craft education as foundation. These abstractions should influence a landing page that feels functionally elegant, craft-authentic, and skill-building—a single scrolling experience where woodworking becomes teachable mastery.
