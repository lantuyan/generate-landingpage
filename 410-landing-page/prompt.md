# Paper Engineering Landing Page

A Paper Engineering visual identity carrying polite glitch and formal play, built for a community logistics hub that folds complex coordination into elegant, understandable systems. The emotional tenor balances awe and intimacy, gravity and lightness, expressed through two-tone duotone with one forbidden color—a paper-cut coral that emerges at interaction points.

Typography folds and unfolds across a workshop table spatial metaphor, with accordion expansion scrolling that mimics pop-up book reveals. Motion follows a paper-flip cadence, elements hinging and rotating with origami logic. Spacing creates creases—compressed where folds meet, expansive where panels open to their full dimension.

Reference anchors: The structural poetry of Shigeru Ban's cardboard architecture, where humble materials achieve monumentality, shapes the material philosophy. The mathematical art of M.C. Escher's impossible constructions informs the spatial surprises. The craft of paper marbling, with its controlled chaos of floating pigments, provides the decorative accents within structural clarity.
