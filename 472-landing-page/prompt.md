# Synthetic Biology Garden Landing Page

A Synthetic Biology Garden philosophy expressed through formal play and polite glitch cultivates this private learning studio. Emotional photosynthesis balances clarity and mystery alongside awe and intimacy—education as engineered growth. Stormy blues interrupted by ember red create controlled chaos: deep learning atmospheres with warning-bright moments of breakthrough.

Typography mutates across the page, letterforms with genetic variation within family resemblance. Spacing creates petri dish margins, isolation zones where ideas can develop without contamination. The spiral reveal scroll choreography mimics DNA helix, information unwinding in biological pattern. Motion embraces gentle orbit—elements revolving like cell cultures in observation. The botanical lab bench spatial metaphor presents curriculum as specimens for cultivation, learning as lab practice.

Reference anchors: Nicholas Grimshaw's Eden Project biomes housing environments; the BioArt movement's living canvases; the tactile craft of botanical pressing where specimens become permanent records. These make learning feel like guided cultivation.
