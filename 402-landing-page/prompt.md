# Sonic Blueprint Landing Page

A Sonic Blueprint design language carrying polite glitch and whispered maximalism, crafted for a private learning studio that transforms self-education into a composed, rhythmic journey. The mood navigates between serenity and urgency, gravity and lightness, expressed through stormy blues interrupted by ember red—sound waves made visible in chromatic tension.

The typography pulses with signal pulse motion, letters arriving like transmitted frequencies across a subway platform wayfinding spatial metaphor. Spiral reveal scrolling pulls users deeper into concentric rings of content, where spacing expands and contracts like sonic dynamics. The emotional storyline crescendos from a whisper to a clear tone, then resolves into harmonic stillness.

Reference anchors: The acoustic architecture of Renzo Piano's Parco della Musica provides spatial resonance logic. The synaesthetic experiments of Bauhaus—particularly Kandinsky's painted sounds—inform color-as-frequency decisions. The craft of lutherie, where wood grain affects timbre, shapes how surface textures carry informational weight.
