# Neobrutalist with Warm Monolith Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE merging **Neobrutalist** design with a **Warm Monolith** micro-style overlay. Conceive an innovative business concept for a cooperative housing development platform that helps groups form, find land, and build intentional communities—providing legal templates, financial modeling, and development guidance for those creating alternatives to conventional housing. The page should feel **rebellious** yet **grounded** from first contact—visitors sensing both the brutalist rejection of housing market norms and the solid foundation of community building. The visual hierarchy shouts with brutalist honesty while warm monumentality suggests the lasting structures being created. Incorporate **mineral tones with one vivid pop** as accent-color behavior—raw restraint with strategic accent marking community milestones.

The design philosophy embraces a **crescendo** scrolling rhythm—building toward the commitment of community formation. Typography channels **judicial authority**, feeling like cooperative bylaws and development documents, institutional voice for alternative structures. The **polished stone** texture metaphor adds permanence to housing content, community as lasting as built foundations. Layouts follow **bold frames** geometric language—heavy borders containing content like property boundaries defining community. Motion embodies **museum-slow** personality—deliberate transitions respecting the weight of housing decisions. The emotional arc flows: first impression of honest alternative → curiosity about cooperative models → trust through community examples → desire for housing autonomy → clarity of formation process → commitment to cooperative living.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of **modernist civic architecture**—brutalism serving housing access. Channel **monolithic stone sculptures** suggesting community permanence. Reference **zen gardens** suggesting that intentional community enables presence. These abstractions should influence a landing page that feels radically honest, practically helpful, and community-empowering—a single scrolling experience where cooperative housing becomes achievable.
