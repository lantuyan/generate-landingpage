# Neo-Geo with Analog Tech Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE merging **Neo-Geo** design with an **Analog Tech** micro-style overlay. Conceive an innovative business concept for a film photography lab network that provides mail-in processing, high-resolution scanning, and print services—connecting analog photographers with quality labs and creating community around film shooting. The page should feel **daring** yet **grounded** from first contact—visitors sensing both the bold geometric energy and the tactile reality of film processing. The visual hierarchy explodes with geometric confidence while analog touches honor darkroom heritage. Incorporate **single neon thread** as accent-color behavior—bold geometry with one accent threading like light leaks on film.

The design philosophy embraces a **spiral** scrolling rhythm—information circling with increasing depth, mirroring the developing process. Typography channels **artisan craft**, feeling like lab documentation from master printers, technical with analog soul. The **satin metal** texture metaphor adds processing equipment elegance throughout, canisters and reels as precision instruments. Layouts follow **oblique cuts** geometric language—diagonal slices creating dynamic energy, nothing static in chemical photography. Motion embodies **frictiony slide** personality—elements with slight resistance like film advancing through cameras. The emotional arc flows: first impression of analog boldness → curiosity about lab coverage → trust through processing quality → desire for developed film → clarity of service workflow → commitment to analog photography.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of **high-end atelier craftsmanship**—film processing as precision art. Channel **scientific instrument panels** where chemistry becomes visible development. Reference **artisanal ceramics studio** where patience creates permanent images. These abstractions should influence a landing page that feels geometrically bold, analogically authentic, and community-building—a single scrolling experience where film photography finds quality processing.
