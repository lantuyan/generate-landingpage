# Brutalist Web Design Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE using a **Brutalist Web** design style. Conceive an innovative business concept for a web archive and digital preservation service that captures and stores websites, online content, and digital artifacts for researchers, historians, and organizations concerned with preserving internet history. The page should evoke a sense of raw digital authenticity and functional honesty from the first moment. Visitors should feel the pure utility of the early web—where design serves function exclusively, browser-default elements become aesthetic statement, and the absence of polish itself communicates integrity. The visual hierarchy should feel like browsing source code or early web—perhaps deliberately harsh typographic choices, Times New Roman as intentional statement, compositions that reject smooth modern conventions. Incorporate an intentionally limited palette—browser-default blues, stark blacks on white, perhaps system colors, refusing the refinement of contemporary design.

The typography should feel system-default or deliberately harsh—Times, Courier, Arial as conscious choices, sizes that feel database-like, hierarchy through HTML defaults rather than design system. Interactions should feel raw—hyperlinks as underlined blue, hover states as browser-defaults, minimal JavaScript, perhaps intentional roughness. The single-page journey should emotionally progress from immediate aesthetic statement (hero that declares brutalist intent), through functional information (services explained with no-nonsense clarity), to direct action (call-to-action as simple hyperlink or form). The narrative arc celebrates digital preservation, internet history, and the honest integrity of functional design.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of digital archaeology—the importance of preserving what's being lost, the authenticity of historical artifacts, the research value of archived content. Reference the aesthetics of early web, the intentional brutalism of anti-design movements, the honest functionality of database interfaces. Think of the disappearing internet, the value of digital preservation, the researchers and historians who need archived content. These abstract references should influence a design that feels intentionally raw, functionally honest, and authentically anti-designed.
