# Sonic Blueprint Landing Page

A Sonic Blueprint approach carrying silent comedy and anti-symmetry elegance, crafted for a quiet finance companion where money moves like musical phrases across measured time. The mood oscillates between serenity and urgency, clarity and mystery, expressed through two-tone duotone with one forbidden color—a harmonic bronze that resonates at key transitions.

Typography has score-like precision, arranged on a theatre stage spatial metaphor with scene cuts scrolling that treats financial sections as movements. Motion follows a magnetic snap tempo, numbers finding their positions with conductor timing. Spacing creates musical rests—silences that structure the rhythmic flow of information.

Reference anchors: The acoustic geometry of Hans Scharoun's Berlin Philharmonie, where architecture becomes instrument, shapes the sonic-spatial philosophy. The visual notation experiments of John Cage's graphic scores inform the alternative reading patterns. The craft of piano tuning, with its precise harmonic relationships, guides the calibrated element relationships.
