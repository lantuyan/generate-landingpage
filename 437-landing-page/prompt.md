# Hyperlocal Craft Ledger Landing Page

A Hyperlocal Craft Ledger visual identity infused with formal play and calm chaos, built for an ethical AI toolkit that documents algorithmic decisions with ledger precision and neighborhood intimacy. The emotional architecture oscillates between gravity and lightness, clarity and mystery, rendered through a single strange accent that appears like a clue—a notary jade that authenticates each entry.

Typography sits in ruled columns, arranged across a workshop table spatial metaphor with stair-step certainty scrolling that catalogues AI behaviors methodically. Motion carries a paper-flip quality, pages turning with documentary weight. Spacing respects the ledger line—regular vertical rhythm with calculated annotations in margins.

Reference anchors: The bureaucratic warmth of Scandinavian municipal buildings, with their civic accessibility and material honesty, shapes the institutional intimacy. The accumulative ordering of On Kawara's date paintings informs the documentary persistence. The craft of double-entry bookkeeping, with its balanced columns and cross-referenced entries, provides the structural integrity.
