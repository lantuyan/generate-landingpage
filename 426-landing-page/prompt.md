# Paper Engineering Landing Page

A Paper Engineering visual system carrying whispered maximalism and anti-symmetry elegance, crafted for a climate-adaptive home guidance service where information unfolds like architectural origami. The mood toggles between awe and intimacy, serenity and urgency, expressed through pastels with one surgical hue—a fold-line scarlet that defines structural creases.

Typography hinges and rotates, arranged on a workshop table spatial metaphor with accordion expansion scrolling that mimics pop-up mechanics. Motion follows a paper-flip cadence, elements opening with the satisfaction of well-engineered reveals. Spacing respects the fold—compressed at hinges, generous on open panels.

Reference anchors: The kinetic surprise of Charles and Ray Eames' House of Cards, where flat becomes dimensional, shapes the transformation philosophy. The structural whimsy of Bruno Munari's children's books informs the playful engineering. The craft of vellum bookbinding, with its folded signatures and gathered sections, provides the organizational architecture.
