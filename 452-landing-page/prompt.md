# Sonic Blueprint Landing Page

A Sonic Blueprint aesthetic merges polite glitch and whispered maximalism for a private learning studio platform. The experience balances nostalgia and futurism against serenity and urgency—like hearing a familiar melody reconstructed through new frequencies. Two-tone duotone with one forbidden color creates visual resonance: deep navy and warm cream interrupted by an almost-wrong chartreuse that signals discovery moments.

The typography pulses with signal pulse motion, letters arriving like sound waves finding form. Spacing breathes in accordion expansion rhythm, sections compressing and releasing like audio dynamics. The spatial metaphor channels a theatre stage where learning moments perform under careful lighting. Each scroll position represents a movement in a larger composition, building toward crescendo understanding.

Reference anchors: The suspended acoustics of Tadao Ando's meditation spaces; Bauhaus's systematic yet soulful approach to functional beauty; the tactile craft of letterpress printing where impression meets paper with considered force. These create an atmosphere of structured discovery.
