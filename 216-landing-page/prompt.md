# Art Deco with Analog Tech Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE merging **Art Deco** design with an **Analog Tech** micro-style overlay. Conceive an innovative business concept for a classic car maintenance platform that connects vintage vehicle owners with specialized mechanics, parts suppliers, and restoration experts—preserving automotive heritage through a network of craftspeople. The page should feel **ceremonial** yet **grounded** from first contact—visitors sensing both the grandeur of automotive history and the practical reality of maintaining classics. The visual hierarchy celebrates through geometric ornament while analog touches suggest garage workshops. Incorporate **gradient wash** as accent-color behavior—rich color transitions evoking chrome finishes and custom paint.

The design philosophy embraces a **spiral** scrolling rhythm—information circling with increasing depth, mirroring the layered expertise of vintage maintenance. Typography channels **artisan craft**, feeling like shop manuals from master mechanics, technical with heritage pride. The **satin metal** texture metaphor adds chrome and steel throughout, the materials of classic automobiles. Layouts follow **concentric geometry** geometric language—radiating patterns from central vehicles, the owner at heart of expanding service network. Motion embodies **frictiony slide** personality—elements with slight resistance like vintage controls, analog feedback. The emotional arc flows: first impression of automotive grandeur → curiosity about network expertise → trust through restoration portfolios → desire for maintained classics → clarity of service access → commitment to automotive preservation.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of **high-end atelier craftsmanship**—classic cars as rolling sculpture deserving care. Channel **scientific instrument panels** suggesting the gauges of vintage dashboards. Reference **cathedral-like verticality** aspiring toward automotive artistry. These abstractions should influence a landing page that feels historically elegant, mechanically authentic, and heritage-preserving—a single scrolling experience where classic cars find expert care.
