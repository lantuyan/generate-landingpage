# Ritual Minimalism Landing Page

A Ritual Minimalism aesthetic infused with tender machinery and anti-symmetry elegance, built for a health routine architect that transforms daily habits into meaningful ceremonies. The emotional architecture toggles between quiet and spectacle, clarity and mystery, rendered through a single strange accent that appears like a clue—a ceremonial gold that marks moments of transition.

Typography is spare and intentional, each word a placed offering within a museum corridor spatial metaphor. Slow zoom scrolling draws users into increasingly focused attention, motion carrying a museum-slow reverence. Spacing is liturgical—vast silences between elements that invite contemplation, tight clustering at moments of instruction.

Reference anchors: The sacred geometry of Tadao Ando's Church of the Light, where reduction amplifies presence, shapes the essential aesthetic. The meditative repetition of Agnes Martin's grid paintings informs the quiet visual rhythm. The craft of tea ceremony utensils, where every object is chosen and placed with intention, guides the purposeful arrangement.
