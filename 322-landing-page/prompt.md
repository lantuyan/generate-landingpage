# Synthetic Biology Garden Landing Page

Synthetic Biology Garden with slow shock and museum-grade whimsy cultivates this private learning studio. The emotional ecosystem thrives between discipline and warmth, quiet and spectacle, through pastels with one surgical hue—a precise chlorophyll green marking growth moments.

Typography grows like designed organisms, each font family a cultivar bred for specific learning environments. The botanical lab bench spatial metaphor arranges courses like specimens in growth medium. Tide in / tide out scroll choreography mimics natural learning rhythms—absorption followed by integration, then new exposure. Ceramic glaze shine gives interactive elements biological luminescence. Motion flows with liquid drift, knowledge nutrients moving through educational membranes.

Three anchors: archive architecture that preserves learning lineage while enabling new growth; ceramic studio patience understanding that mastery requires sustained cultivation; ritual objects investing learning tools with sacred purpose.
