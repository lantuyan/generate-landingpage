# Bauhaus with Warm Monolith Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE merging **Bauhaus** design with a **Warm Monolith** micro-style overlay. Conceive an innovative business concept for an employee equity education platform that helps startup workers understand their stock options—visualizing vesting schedules, modeling exit scenarios, and explaining tax implications in plain language. The page should feel **confident** yet **tender** from first contact—visitors sensing both the authority of financial knowledge and the care for often-confused employees. The visual hierarchy presents with Bauhaus clarity, primary shapes and colors organizing complex financial concepts. Incorporate **mineral tones with one vivid pop** as accent-color behavior—warm neutrals with strategic accent marking key calculations.

The design philosophy embraces a **staircase** scrolling rhythm—ascending through equity understanding levels, each plateau a new tier of comprehension. Typography channels **friendly mentor**, feeling like a knowledgeable colleague explaining what HR can't, accessible expertise. The **polished stone** texture metaphor adds weight to financial content, equity decisions as permanent as carved stone. Layouts follow **modular tiles** geometric language—Bauhaus blocks containing distinct concepts, complexity made manageable. Motion embodies **museum-slow** personality—deliberate transitions that encourage comprehension over scanning, respect for learning pace. The emotional arc flows: first impression of clarifying authority → curiosity about personal equity → trust through calculation accuracy → desire for informed decisions → clarity of platform features → commitment to equity literacy.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of **modernist civic architecture**—Bauhaus principles serving practical function. Channel **scientific instrument panels** making invisible financial forces visible. Reference **quiet museum galleries** designed for focused learning. These abstractions should influence a landing page that feels pedagogically elegant, financially trustworthy, and personally empowering—a single scrolling experience where stock options become understandable.
