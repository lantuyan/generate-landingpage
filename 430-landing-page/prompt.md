# Optical Field Notes Landing Page

An Optical Field Notes approach carrying calm chaos and museum-grade whimsy, crafted for an ethical AI toolkit that observes machine behavior with naturalist precision. The mood oscillates between awe and intimacy, clarity and mystery, expressed through stormy blues interrupted by ember red—observation flares in algorithmic wilderness.

Typography has specimen-label precision, arranged across a botanical lab bench spatial metaphor with tide in / tide out scrolling that mimics fieldwork rhythms. Motion follows a subtle tremor quality, as if recording instruments detect micro-movements. Spacing reflects expedition notation—compressed in active observation, expansive in theoretical reflection.

Reference anchors: The scientific romance of Darwin's Beagle voyage journals, where wonder meets method, shapes the documentary intimacy. The systematic beauty of Joseph Cornell's boxed collections informs the curated specimen approach. The craft of specimen pressing, with its patience and preservation intention, guides the careful treatment of captured insights.
