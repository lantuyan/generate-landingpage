# Optical Field Notes Landing Page

An Optical Field Notes approach with misaligned perfection and bureaucracy but beautiful documents this mindful travel planner. The experience navigates trust and curiosity alongside nostalgia and futurism—journeys as optical phenomena to record. Two-tone duotone with one forbidden color: field notebook tan and observation gray interrupted by specimen violet.

Typography mimics handwritten notation formalized, the urgency of discovery captured in systematic type. Spacing creates margin notes and figure references, academic precision with travel warmth. The map journey scroll choreography guides users through destination terrains, each section a new field study page. Motion carries signal pulse energy—elements transmitting like data from distant observation points. The observatory deck spatial metaphor positions travel planning as careful watching and recording.

Reference anchors: Alvar Aalto's organic modernism responding to landscape; the Land Art movement's documentation of temporary interventions; the tactile craft of field journaling where observation becomes memory. These transform trip planning into expedition documentation.
