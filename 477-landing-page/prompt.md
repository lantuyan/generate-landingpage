# Urban Fossil Modernism Landing Page

An Urban Fossil Modernism approach with polite glitch and formal play excavates this micro-volunteering network. The emotional strata balance trust and curiosity alongside quiet and spectacle—small acts as urban fossils worth preserving. Two-tone duotone with one forbidden color: city concrete and sediment brown interrupted by activist orange.

Typography appears partially excavated, some letters crisp while others emerge from urban deposits. Spacing creates archaeological sections, gridded zones of careful community attention. The scene cuts scroll choreography presents volunteer opportunities as distinct dig sites, each cut revealing new strata of need. Motion carries subtle tremor—elements with the vibration of urban life beneath surface. The subway platform wayfinding spatial metaphor transforms volunteering into urban navigation, help as destination.

Reference anchors: Marcel Breuer's brutalist buildings aging into archaeology; the Situationist derive through urban psychogeography; the tactile craft of city mapping where streets become arteries. These make micro-volunteering feel like urban archaeology practice.
