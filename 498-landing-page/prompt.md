# Ink & Signal Landing Page

An Ink & Signal aesthetic with museum-grade whimsy and dusty neon transmits this creative workflow atelier. The emotional broadcast balances clarity and mystery alongside quiet and spectacle—creative tools as signals worth decoding from studio noise. Pastels with one surgical hue: transmission soft pink and frequency lavender with signal-lock precision orange.

Typography bleeds at transmission edges, letters with broadcast quality fading in and out of clarity. Spacing creates signal gaps and sync markers, the meaningful silence between creative pulses. The tide in / tide out scroll choreography mimics broadcast rhythm, tools transmitting and receiving in creative cycles. Motion carries magnetic snap—elements locking into position like frequency tuning. The workshop table spatial metaphor presents creative tools as transmission equipment, workflow as broadcast operation.

Reference anchors: Mies van der Rohe's clarity of transmission in glass; the Transmission Art movement's signal aesthetics; the tactile craft of printmaking where pressure transfers meaning. These make creative workflow feel like tuning into personal studio frequency.
