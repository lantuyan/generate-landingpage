# Paper Engineering Landing Page

A Paper Engineering approach with polite glitch and museum-grade whimsy constructs this local maker marketplace. The emotional fold balances nostalgia and futurism alongside trust and curiosity—handmade goods as pop-up architecture. Two-tone duotone with one forbidden color: paper stock cream and fold shadow gray interrupted by maker magenta.

Typography creases at suggestion, letters with dimensional potential waiting to be activated. Spacing creates fold lines and tab zones, engineering schematics for paper transformation. The scene cuts scroll choreography presents each maker as distinct pop-up page, transitions sharp like paper snapping into form. Motion embraces paper-flip energy—products revealing themselves through dimensional rotation. The workshop table spatial metaphor presents the marketplace as construction surface, shopping as assembly project.

Reference anchors: Toyo Ito's ephemeral architecture challenging permanence; the Pop-up book engineering tradition of mechanical pages; the tactile craft of paper sculpture where material defines form. These make marketplace browsing feel like engineering exploration.
