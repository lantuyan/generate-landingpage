# Synthetic Biology Garden Landing Page

A Synthetic Biology Garden approach carrying misaligned perfection and museum-grade whimsy, crafted for a private learning studio where knowledge grows and cross-pollinates like cultivated organisms. The mood balances serenity and urgency, quiet and spectacle, expressed through pastels with one surgical hue—a chlorophyll green that pulses with photosynthetic energy.

Typography sprouts and branches, arranged on a botanical lab bench spatial metaphor with spiral reveal scrolling that follows growth patterns from germination to bloom. Motion breathes with liquid drift, elements flowing like sap through cambium. Spacing follows garden logic—clustered in cultivated beds, open along contemplative paths.

Reference anchors: The botanical architecture of the Eden Project's biomes, where ecosystems are curated and contained, shapes the enclosed garden philosophy. The organic formalism of Georgia O'Keeffe's magnified florals informs the scale-shifting observation. The craft of espalier training, where growth is guided against structure, provides the controlled cultivation aesthetic.
