# Scandinavian with Typographic Sculpture Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE merging **Scandinavian** design with a **Typographic Sculpture** micro-style overlay. Conceive an innovative business concept for a workplace ergonomics assessment service that combines AI posture analysis from video with personalized equipment recommendations and workspace setup guidance—preventing injury through better work environments. The page should feel **serene** yet **confident** from first contact—visitors sensing both the Nordic calm of well-designed workspaces and the authority of ergonomic expertise. The visual hierarchy breathes with generous whitespace while typography takes sculptural form suggesting the body in space. Incorporate **mineral tones with one vivid pop** as accent-color behavior—natural palette with strategic health accent.

The design philosophy embraces a **glide** scrolling rhythm—smooth progression modeling the effortless movement good ergonomics enables. Typography channels **clinical precision**, feeling like ergonomic research made accessible, science serving workers. The **woven fabric** texture metaphor adds tactile comfort throughout, the upholstery and materials of good workspace design. Layouts follow **floating islands** geometric language—assessment components as separate but connected territories, body zones and equipment categories. Motion embodies **gentle breathing** personality—elements with subtle movement suggesting the micro-movements healthy work requires. The emotional arc flows: first impression of healthy design → curiosity about assessment methodology → trust through clinical backing → desire for pain-free work → clarity of service process → commitment to ergonomic improvement.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of **zen gardens**—designed environments for physical wellbeing. Channel **scientific instrument panels** where posture data becomes actionable. Reference **high-end atelier craftsmanship** suggesting workspaces designed with care. These abstractions should influence a landing page that feels peacefully professional, scientifically grounded, and personally caring—a single scrolling experience where workplace ergonomics becomes preventive health.
