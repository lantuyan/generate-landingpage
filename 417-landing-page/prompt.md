# Archaeological UI Landing Page

An Archaeological UI aesthetic infused with diagrammatic romance and calm chaos, built for a private learning studio that treats knowledge as layered sediment to be carefully excavated. The emotional tenor oscillates between clarity and mystery, gravity and lightness, rendered through stormy blues interrupted by ember red—discoveries burning through strata.

Typography is grid-placed yet deliberately aged, arranged across an archive drawer spatial metaphor with chaptered long-take scrolling that moves through epochs of understanding. Motion carries a liquid drift quality, elements settling into geological time. Spacing compresses where knowledge densifies, expands where contemplation is invited.

Reference anchors: The excavation dramaturgy of the Kolumba Museum's Roman-medieval-modern stacking shapes the temporal philosophy. The documentary poetry of the Bechers' industrial typologies informs the systematic collection aesthetic. The craft of archaeological drawing, with its precise cross-sections and contextual notation, guides the information architecture.
