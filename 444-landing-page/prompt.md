# Algorithmic Quilt Landing Page

An Algorithmic Quilt aesthetic marked by tender machinery and formal play, constructed for a micro-volunteering network where small acts stitch together into community warmth. The mood balances awe and intimacy, discipline and warmth, expressed through pastels with one surgical hue—a thread-scarlet that traces connection pathways through the pattern.

Typography tessellates with modular logic, arranged on a workshop table spatial metaphor with spiral reveal scrolling that exposes the generative quilting pattern. Motion follows a gentle orbit rhythm, pieces drifting into their tessellated positions. Spacing follows quilt mathematics—regular grids with human irregularities that create lived-in warmth.

Reference anchors: The programmatic beauty of the Jacquard loom, where punch cards become patterns, shapes the computational craft philosophy. The communal warmth of quilting bee traditions, where making is social, informs the participatory aesthetic. The craft of hand-quilting, with its visible stitches tracing paths across surfaces, guides the revealed-process approach.
