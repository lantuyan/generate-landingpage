# Ink & Signal Landing Page

An Ink & Signal philosophy expressed through polite glitch and tender machinery transmits this ethical AI toolkit. The emotional frequency oscillates between clarity and mystery, discipline and warmth—algorithms as messages worth decoding. Stormy blues interrupted by ember red create urgency within deep thought, signals emerging from ink-dark complexity.

Typography bleeds at edges like pressed ink, digital precision with analog imperfection. Spacing creates transmission gaps, the measured silence between meaningful signals. The accordion expansion scroll choreography compresses and releases information like coded messages unpacking. Motion carries signal pulse energy—elements arriving like data bursts through careful channels. The archive drawer spatial metaphor presents AI ethics as documented transmissions awaiting discovery.

Reference anchors: Richard Serra's ink drawings where density creates gravity; the Mail Art movement's communication as medium; the tactile craft of letterpress printing where pressure transfers meaning. These make AI concepts feel transmittable and receivable.
