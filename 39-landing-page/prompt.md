# Paper Cut Design Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE using the **Paper Cut** design style. Conceive an innovative business concept for a children's educational publishing company creating illustrated books, interactive stories, and learning materials that make education feel like play. The page should evoke a sense of handcrafted wonder and layered discovery from the first moment. Visitors should feel the tactile charm of paper craft—where layers create depth, shadows suggest dimensionality, and every element looks carefully cut and assembled by skilled hands. The visual hierarchy should use layered depth—foreground elements casting shadows on backgrounds, creating storybook-like dimensionality. Incorporate a warm, approachable palette—cheerful primaries, soft pastels, and natural paper textures.

The typography should feel friendly and slightly handmade—rounded letterforms that could be cut from paper, perhaps with subtle texture suggesting craft materials. Interactions should create layered sensations—elements that lift and separate on hover, parallax scrolling that enhances paper-layer depth, transitions that feel like page turns. The single-page journey should emotionally progress from delightful introduction (hero with obvious paper-cut styling and shadow depth), through playful exploration (content as layered scenes and illustrated concepts), to warm invitation (call-to-action that feels like turning to the next chapter). The narrative arc celebrates imagination, craftsmanship, and the magic of storytelling.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of handmade children's art—the proud display of paper creations, the magic of pop-up books, the wonder of shadow puppets. Reference the layered beauty of traditional paper cutting arts (Chinese jianzhi, Japanese kirigami), the illustrated depth of classic children's books, the tactile appeal of craft projects. Think of the joy of making things with hands, the imaginative play of childhood, the timeless appeal of illustrated stories. These abstract references should influence a design that feels lovingly crafted, playfully layered, and wonderfully imaginative.
