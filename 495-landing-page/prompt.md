# Ritual Minimalism Landing Page

A Ritual Minimalism philosophy with anti-symmetry elegance and slow shock sanctifies this ethical AI toolkit. The emotional ceremony balances quiet and spectacle alongside trust and curiosity—AI ethics as sacred practice requiring reverent approach. A single strange accent appears like a clue: ritual scarlet emerging from meditation white and shadow black at moments of ethical decision.

Typography observes ceremonial weight, precise sizing that religious texts and serious documents share. Spacing creates the processional distance between sacred elements, asymmetric arrangements that break expected pattern with purpose. The chaptered long-take scroll choreography moves through AI ethics as continuous ceremony, chapters as ritual stages. Motion embraces museum-slow reverence—concepts arriving with deliberate intention. The museum corridor spatial metaphor presents AI ethics as exhibition of sacred objects requiring slow consideration.

Reference anchors: Luis Barragan's spiritual architecture in color and light; the Zen aesthetic of ma (negative space); the tactile craft of ritual object making where form embodies meaning. These make AI ethics feel like spiritual practice.
