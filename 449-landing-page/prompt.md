# Sonic Blueprint Landing Page

A Sonic Blueprint visual identity carrying slow shock and calm chaos, built for a local maker marketplace where artisan offerings resonate like composed instruments. The emotional architecture balances quiet and spectacle, trust and curiosity, expressed through a mineral palette with a radioactive highlight—sound frequencies made visible in chromatic pulses.

Typography vibrates with harmonic tension, arranged on a theatre stage spatial metaphor with chaptered long-take scrolling that treats each maker category as a movement. Motion follows a liquid drift rhythm, elements flowing like sound waves through space. Spacing creates acoustic dynamics—compression where energy concentrates, expansion where resonance breathes.

Reference anchors: The sonic architecture of Peter Zumthor's Bruder Klaus Chapel, where materials sing, shapes the resonant materiality. The visual music of Oskar Fischinger's abstract animations informs the synesthetic color movement. The craft of cymbal making, with its hammered tones and balanced frequencies, provides the tuned element relationships.
