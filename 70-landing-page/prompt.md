# Forest/Woodland Design Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE using the **Forest/Woodland** design style. Conceive an innovative business concept for a forest therapy and wilderness wellness retreat offering Japanese shinrin-yoku (forest bathing), guided nature meditation, and therapeutic forest immersion programs for stress recovery and mental health. The page should evoke a sense of verdant sanctuary and woodland peace from the first moment. Visitors should feel the embracing presence of forest—where dappled light filters through canopy, layered depth creates mystery and shelter, and the ancient calm of trees pervades. The visual hierarchy should feel organically layered—foreground, midground, and background creating forest depth, content paths that wind like trails, compositions with the vertical emphasis of tree trunks. Incorporate a forest palette—moss greens, bark browns, filtered golden light, shadow purples, and fern-frond accents.

The typography should feel natural yet readable—perhaps organic display faces for headlines suggesting hand-carved wood, clean body text that communicates therapeutic professionalism. Interactions should create forest sensations—elements that rustle with subtle movement, transitions that feel like walking deeper into woods, hover states that respond like touched leaves. The single-page journey should emotionally progress from forest entry (hero with immersive woodland imagery), through deepening exploration (content as clearings in the forest of information), to peaceful invitation (call-to-action that feels like following a guide deeper into healing). The narrative arc celebrates nature therapy, ancestral connection to forests, and the scientifically proven healing of green spaces.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of forest immersion—the dropping of shoulders as canopy closes overhead, the sharpening of senses in natural environment, the time-shift that forest peace creates. Reference the scientific research of forest medicine, the visual poetry of woodland photography, the architectural integration of forest structures. Think of the ancient human history in forests, the therapy of grounding and presence, the forest as healer. These abstract references should influence a design that feels deeply forested, therapeutically calm, and naturally healing.
