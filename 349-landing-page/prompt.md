# Archaeological UI Landing Page

Archaeological UI with whispered maximalism and slow shock unearths this ethical AI toolkit. Emotional excavation moves between gravity and lightness, nostalgia and futurism, through a mineral palette with radioactive highlight—ethical sediment pierced by discovery-signal green.

Typography presents as decoded ethical inscriptions, ancient philosophical wisdom translated for algorithmic governance. The museum corridor spatial metaphor guides users past ethical artifacts, each alcove a different era's approach to machine morality. Spiral reveal scroll choreography digs deeper with each rotation, uncovering layers of ethical consideration. Weathered stone patina ages interface elements with philosophical permanence. Motion operates with gentle orbit, principles circling like artifacts in eternal exhibition.

Three anchors: archive architecture preserving ethical traditions while enabling contemporary application; ritual objects investing AI guidelines with archaeological significance; gallery label writing distilling complex ethics to excavated wisdom.
