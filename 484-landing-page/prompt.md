# Sonic Blueprint Landing Page

A Sonic Blueprint approach with tender machinery and whispered maximalism orchestrates this mindful travel planner. The emotional composition balances clarity and mystery alongside quiet and spectacle—destinations as soundscapes to be notated. Pastels with one surgical hue: soft frequency pink and ambient lavender with tuning-fork precision blue.

Typography vibrates with harmonic precision, letters positioned like notes awaiting performance. Spacing creates musical rests and dynamic markings, the silence that makes sound meaningful. The slow zoom scroll choreography moves from full orchestral overview to solo instrument intimacy, scale shifting like audio focus. Motion carries liquid drift—elements flowing like sound through space. The observatory deck spatial metaphor positions travel as listening post, destinations as frequencies to tune toward.

Reference anchors: Steven Holl's acoustic ceiling forms; the Spectral music movement's analysis of sound as architecture; the tactile craft of instrument making where shape determines tone. These make trip planning feel like composing a journey score.
