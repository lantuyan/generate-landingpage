# Urban Fossil Modernism Landing Page

An Urban Fossil Modernism visual identity woven with slow shock and precision fog, designed for a quiet finance companion that reads economic patterns in urban geological time. The emotional register oscillates between clarity and mystery, gravity and lightness, rendered through a mineral palette with a radioactive highlight—value fossilized and glowing.

Typography has the permanence of carved inscription, arranged across an observatory deck spatial metaphor with stair-step certainty scrolling that descends through economic strata. Motion carries a museum-slow weight, numbers settling into sedimentary positions. Spacing acknowledges compression—tight where wealth accumulates, expansive where opportunity erodes.

Reference anchors: The monumental permanence of Marcel Breuer's brutalist museums shapes the geological formalism. The urban excavation of Anne and Patrick Poirier's archaeological installations informs the revealed-history approach. The craft of stone rubbing, where surface patterns are transferred through patient friction, provides the documentary texture.
