# Paper Engineering Landing Page

A Paper Engineering philosophy with whispered maximalism and bureaucracy but beautiful folds this climate-adaptive home guidance platform. Emotional construction balances awe and intimacy alongside discipline and warmth—sustainability as paper architecture to be assembled. A mineral palette with radioactive highlight: origami cream and fold-shadow gray with environmental alert green.

Typography creases along invisible lines, letters suggesting dimensional transformation in waiting. Spacing creates fold patterns and tab margins, the geometric logic of flat-to-dimensional. The stair-step certainty scroll choreography builds understanding through progressive folding, each section adding structural clarity. Motion embraces paper-flip energy—elements rotating along hinges to reveal hidden guidance. The workshop table spatial metaphor presents home solutions as paper models awaiting assembly, climate action as craft project.

Reference anchors: Shigeru Ban's disaster relief paper architecture; the Constructivist movement's utopian paper models; the tactile craft of architectural model making where scale enables understanding. These make home sustainability feel buildable by hand.
