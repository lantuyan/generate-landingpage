# Algorithmic Quilt Landing Page

Algorithmic Quilt with precision fog and slow shock stitches this local maker marketplace. The emotional pattern weaves between trust and curiosity, discipline and warmth, through warm grayscale with sudden sunrise band—craft neutrality punctuated by artisan-discovery amber.

Typography tessellates like pattern pieces, each maker profile a square in the marketplace tapestry. The archive drawer spatial metaphor organizes artisans like quilt blocks filed by craft category. Scene cuts scroll choreography transitions between maker sections with patchwork logic, each shift revealing new pattern possibilities. Silk-screen ink grain gives each product listing handcrafted authenticity. Motion pulses with signal rhythm, craft connections clicking into quilt configuration.

Reference anchors: printmaking grain celebrating the reproducible beauty of artisan work; ritual objects investing handmade goods with ceremonial weight; bookbinding craft understanding how individual pieces assemble into collected meaning.
