# Art Nouveau Design Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE using the **Art Nouveau** design style. Conceive an innovative business concept for a botanical perfumery that creates small-batch fragrances using rare flowers, sustainable harvesting practices, and traditional perfume-making techniques passed down through generations. The page should evoke a sense of organic elegance and natural artistry from the first moment. Visitors should feel enveloped in flowing beauty—where every line curves with the grace of growing vines, borders bloom with stylized florals, and decoration and function intertwine like garden tendrils. The visual hierarchy should flow organically—sinuous lines guiding the eye, asymmetric but balanced compositions, content framed by decorative elements that feel alive. Incorporate a nature-inspired palette—deep forest greens, iris purples, rose golds, and cream backgrounds suggesting aged paper.

The typography should feel era-appropriate yet readable—elegant display faces with organic character, body text that complements without competing with decorative elements. Interactions should create flowing sensations—elements that unfurl like blooming flowers, lines that draw themselves organically, hover states that respond with natural grace. The single-page journey should emotionally progress from enchanting introduction (hero with flowing Art Nouveau borders and botanical imagery), through romantic discovery (content framed by organic ornamentation), to graceful invitation (call-to-action nestled within decorative flourishes). The narrative arc celebrates natural beauty, artistic craft, and the integration of function and ornamentation.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of botanical gardens at peak bloom—the overwhelming beauty of nature's design, the careful cultivation of living art. Reference the flowing lines of Mucha posters, the organic architecture of Gaudi, the integrated ornament of Tiffany glass. Think of the meditative practice of perfume creation, the patience of cultivating rare flowers, the sensory pleasure of natural fragrances. These abstract references should influence a design that feels organically elegant, naturally beautiful, and artistically refined.
