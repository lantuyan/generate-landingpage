# Algorithmic Quilt Landing Page

An Algorithmic Quilt visual system marked by whispered maximalism and diagrammatic romance, designed for an ethical AI toolkit that stitches transparent machine learning into warm, understandable patterns. The mood balances trust and curiosity, discipline and warmth, expressed through pastels with one surgical hue—a decision-tree teal that traces computational paths.

Typography is modular and repeating, arranged on a workshop table spatial metaphor where spiral reveal scrolling exposes the pattern's underlying logic. Motion breathes with gentle orbit rhythm, elements finding their tessellated positions. Spacing follows quilt-block mathematics—regular grids with intentional disruptions that create visual rhythm.

Reference anchors: The geometric domesticity of Gee's Bend quilts, where improvisation meets tradition, shapes the patterned warmth. The systematic beauty of Sol LeWitt's wall drawings, where instructions become art, informs the algorithmic transparency. The craft of hand-piecing, with its accumulation of small decisions into coherent wholes, guides the user's journey through complexity.
