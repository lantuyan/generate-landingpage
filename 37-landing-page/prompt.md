# Isometric Design Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE using the **Isometric** design style. Conceive an innovative business concept for a urban planning visualization studio that creates interactive 3D city models helping municipalities communicate development plans to citizens and stakeholders. The page should evoke a sense of dimensional clarity and systematic understanding from the first moment. Visitors should feel the satisfying perspective of isometric projection—where complex systems become comprehensible through consistent angles and the illusion of depth without vanishing points. The visual hierarchy should feel architecturally constructed—buildings, systems, and concepts rendered in clean isometric illustration, creating a unified world view. Incorporate a balanced palette that distinguishes different system elements—buildings in warm tones, infrastructure in cool tones, greenspace in natural colors.

The typography should feel systematic and clear—geometric sans-serifs that complement the precision of isometric illustration, weights and sizes creating clear information hierarchy. Interactions should create constructive sensations—elements that build into place, isometric scenes that animate through assembly, hover states that highlight system components. The single-page journey should emotionally progress from dimensional introduction (hero showcasing isometric cityscape or system visualization), through systematic exploration (content illustrated with isometric diagrams and scenes), to constructive action (call-to-action integrated into the isometric world). The narrative arc celebrates systems thinking, visual clarity, and the power of perspective to create understanding.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of architectural models—the god's-eye view of complex systems, the satisfying consistency of scale and proportion. Reference the explanatory power of technical illustration, the playful precision of construction games, the educational clarity of cutaway diagrams. Think of the intellectual pleasure of understanding how things fit together, the urban planner's helicopter view, the comprehension that comes from seeing the whole system at once. These abstract references should influence a design that feels dimensionally clear, systematically organized, and visually instructive.
