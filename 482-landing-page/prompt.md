# Ink & Signal Landing Page

An Ink & Signal aesthetic with diagrammatic romance and slow shock transmits this health routine architect platform. The emotional broadcast balances serenity and urgency alongside gravity and lightness—wellness as signal to decode from noise. A mineral palette with radioactive highlight: ink black and paper white with vital-sign green transmission bursts.

Typography bleeds signal into page, letters with transmission edges fuzzing into reception. Spacing creates broadcast gaps, the silence between meaningful pulses. The accordion expansion scroll choreography compresses and releases health information like coded wellness transmissions. Motion carries magnetic snap—elements locking into position like signal acquisition. The archive drawer spatial metaphor presents health routines as documented transmissions, wellness protocols as archived broadcasts awaiting replay.

Reference anchors: Cedric Price's information architecture ahead of its time; the Fluxus movement's mail art transmissions; the tactile craft of morse key operation where rhythm carries meaning. These make health routines feel like signals worth tuning to receive.
