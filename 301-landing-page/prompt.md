# Archaeological UI Landing Page

An Archaeological UI approach with misaligned perfection and tender machinery guides this climate-adaptive home guidance platform. The mood oscillates between awe and intimacy, clarity and mystery, rendered through a mineral palette punctuated by a radioactive highlight that emerges like ancient findings unearthed from digital sediment.

Typography behaves like excavated inscriptions—weighted with history yet precisely catalogued. Spacing breathes like the silence between discoveries in a museum corridor. The chaptered long-take scroll unfolds layers of dwelling wisdom, each section a stratum revealing sustainable living insights. Motion carries a museum-slow quality, honoring the gravity of environmental stewardship while maintaining approachable warmth.

Three reference anchors shape this experience: archive architecture with its reverence for preserved knowledge and systematic revelation; field-journal documentation that captures observations with scientific care yet personal wonder; ceramic studio patience that understands transformation requires time, heat, and the steady hand of craft.
