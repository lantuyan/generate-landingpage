# Urban Fossil Modernism Landing Page

An Urban Fossil Modernism approach woven with misaligned perfection and tender machinery, designed for a local maker marketplace that honors the deep time embedded in handcraft traditions. The emotional register oscillates between nostalgia and futurism, discipline and warmth, rendered through a mineral palette with a radioactive highlight—patina meeting innovation.

Typography has the weight of carved stone and the precision of digital tools, arranged across an observatory deck spatial metaphor with slow zoom scrolling that focuses through temporal layers. Motion carries a museum-slow quality, elements settling like sediment. Spacing acknowledges accumulation—dense where traditions layer, open where new practices emerge.

Reference anchors: The material honesty of Louis Kahn's monumental ruins, where concrete ages like stone, shapes the temporal presence. The urban archaeology of Gordon Matta-Clark's building cuts informs the revealed stratigraphy. The craft of stone carving, with its respect for material grain and geological history, provides the enduring surface quality.
