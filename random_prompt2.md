You must generate a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE creation prompt that is EXACTLY THREE PARAGRAPHS (no titles, no bullets, no extra lines). Before writing, perform a true variety randomization ritual: create an internal seed by imagining a 10-character string (letters+digits), then use it to “draw” choices as if shuffling cards. Do NOT reveal the seed or the method. Now randomly select: (1) 1 primary design style from the list below OR a professional style of your own with a strict 15% chance, (2) 1 secondary micro-style overlay (choose from: “Typographic Sculpture”, “Soft Industrial”, “Dusty Futurism”, “Museum Labeling”, “Parametric Calm”, “Analog Tech”, “Quiet Opulence”, “Playful Precision”, “Zen Kinetics”, “Warm Monolith”), (3) 2 emotional adjectives (from: electric, serene, daring, intimate, ceremonial, optimistic, enigmatic, grounded, weightless, confident, tender, rebellious), (4) 1 scrolling rhythm (from: crescendo, pulse, glide, staccato, tide, staircase, cinematic dissolve, spiral), (5) 1 accent-color behavior (from: “rare sparks”, “gradient wash”, “confetti highlights”, “single neon thread”, “sunset haze”, “mineral tones with one vivid pop”), (6) 1 texture metaphor (from: frosted glass, polished stone, recycled paper grain, satin metal, soft rubber, ink bleed, ceramic glaze, woven fabric, liquid chrome), (7) 1 geometric language (from: strict grid, asymmetric tension, modular tiles, floating islands, bold frames, concentric geometry, oblique cuts, organic blobs, micro-grids), (8) 1 type personality (from: judicial authority, friendly mentor, clinical precision, poetic editorial, futuristic calm, artisan craft), (9) 1 motion personality (from: liquid drift, magnetic snap, gentle breathing, kinetic flicker, museum-slow, elastic bounce, frictiony slide, razor-clean fades), and (10) 1 business/service concept direction (from: climate resilience, creator economy, personal health, mindful finance, education, logistics, community tools, productivity, travel, home design). Then conceive an innovative business/service concept that fits the chosen direction and style. Paragraph 1 must state the chosen style(s) and introduce the concept for a SINGLE-PAGE landing page, describing the arrival mood and how the visual hierarchy and flow should make visitors feel as they scroll one cohesive page; include a note to incorporate colorful elements in the specific “accent-color behavior” you drew to amplify emotion. Use the style list: Neobrutalist, Swiss/International, Editorial, Glassmorphism, Retro-futuristic, Bauhaus, Art Deco, Minimal, Flat, Material, Neumorphic, Monochromatic, Scandinavian, Japandi, Dark Mode First, Modernist, Organic/Fluid, Corporate Professional, Tech Forward, Luxury Minimal, Neo-Geo, Kinetic, Gradient Modern, Typography First, Metropolitan.

Paragraph 2 must explain the design philosophy entirely through emotion and user experience, explicitly weaving in the randomly chosen scrolling rhythm, texture metaphor, geometric language, type personality, and motion personality. Describe how typography should feel (authoritative, welcoming, cutting-edge, etc.) based on the type personality you drew, and how interactions/animations should feel based on the motion personality you drew—without technical implementation details. Describe a single-page emotional narrative arc: first impression → curiosity → trust → desire → clarity → commitment, all within one scrolling experience that feels continuous and intentional, never like separate pages stitched together. The user should feel guided, not pushed; intrigued, not overwhelmed; the energy should evolve according to the scrolling rhythm you drew. Maintain a cohesive atmospheric tone and keep the landing page as one unified canvas from top to final call-to-action.

Paragraph 3 must provide abstract reference points that capture the aesthetic essence—choose exactly THREE conceptual references internally at random from this pool (do not name brands/platforms): “quiet museum galleries”, “modernist civic architecture”, “mid-century editorial layouts”, “zen gardens”, “high-end atelier craftsmanship”, “metro transit wayfinding”, “experimental theater lighting”, “scientific instrument panels”, “artisanal ceramics studio”, “cathedral-like verticality”, “desert twilight gradients”, “ballet rehearsal minimalism”, “parametric architecture models”, “monolithic stone sculptures”, “hand-bound bookmaking”. Use those references to describe the premium emotional qualities and refined craftsmanship that should inspire the design. Explain how these abstract references should influence the emotional quality, compositional sophistication, and perceived value of the final ONE COHESIVE LANDING PAGE with a single scrolling journey—high-level, conceptual, and open to interpretation, with no technical specs and no concrete brand callouts.
