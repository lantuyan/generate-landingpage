# Sonic Blueprint Landing Page

A Sonic Blueprint aesthetic with diagrammatic romance and calm chaos orchestrates this creative workflow atelier. Emotional frequency balances quiet and spectacle alongside gravity and lightness—creative tools as musical notation to be performed. Two-tone duotone with one forbidden color: score paper cream and conductor black interrupted by fortissimo magenta.

Typography scores across the page, text positioned like notes on invisible staves with dynamic markings. Spacing creates measures and rests, the rhythmic structure that makes melody possible. The chaptered long-take scroll choreography unfolds as continuous composition, movements building toward creative crescendo. Motion carries magnetic snap precision—elements finding positions like musicians hitting marks. The theatre stage spatial metaphor presents workflow tools as orchestral sections awaiting conductor arrangement.

Reference anchors: Hans Scharoun's Berlin Philharmonic wrapping audience around performance; the Fluxus movement's scores for impossible performances; the tactile craft of music engraving where notation becomes visual music. These make creative workflow feel like composition in progress.
