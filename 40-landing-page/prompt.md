# Hand-Drawn/Illustrated Design Landing Page

Create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE using the **Hand-Drawn/Illustrated** design style. Conceive an innovative business concept for an artisan coffee roastery that sources single-origin beans directly from small farmers, emphasizing the human stories behind each cup through illustrated journey maps. The page should evoke a sense of authentic craft and personal connection from the first moment. Visitors should feel the warmth of human touch—where every line reveals an artist's hand and imperfection becomes proof of genuineness. The visual hierarchy should feel sketched and organic—illustrated elements guiding the eye naturally, hand-drawn borders and decorations creating warmth without rigid structure. Incorporate a natural palette—coffee browns, cream, warm terracotta, and touches of green suggesting origin landscapes.

The typography should feel hand-lettered or carefully chosen to complement illustrations—perhaps mixing actual hand-drawn headlines with readable body fonts, creating the feel of an illustrated journal. Interactions should create tactile, organic sensations—elements that appear to be drawn in, sketch-like animations that feel alive, hover states that add illustrated details. The single-page journey should emotionally progress from warm welcome (hero with illustrated coffee journey or origin landscape), through story discovery (content accompanied by custom illustrations), to personal invitation (call-to-action that feels like receiving a handwritten note). The narrative arc celebrates craft, origin stories, and the human connections behind products.

Draw inspiration from the emotional qualities of artisan workshops—the visible evidence of skilled hands, the personality expressed through making, the stories embedded in handmade objects. Reference the intimate atmosphere of illustrated journals, the narrative power of graphic storytelling, the trustworthy charm of hand-painted signage. Think of the connection felt when meeting the maker, the authentic appeal of small-batch production, the warmth of brands with visible human touch. These abstract references should influence a design that feels genuinely handcrafted, warmly personal, and authentically artisan.
